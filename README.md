# Purple Team Roadmap — 52 Weeks

A structured 52-week roadmap focused on becoming a **Purple Team / Detection Engineer**  
with strong hands-on experience in **attack simulation, detection engineering, and incident response**.

This plan is designed for:
- High-impact cybersecurity roles (Detection / Purple Team / AppSec)
- 2027 placement readiness
- Long-term financial independence & early retirement mindset

---

## Core Principle

**Attack → Detect → Document → Repeat**

Each week focuses on:
- One primary technical objective
- One tangible output (code, detection rule, report, or write-up)

---

## Tech Stack

- Linux (Primary OS)
- Elastic Stack (ELK)
- Sigma Rules
- MITRE ATT&CK
- Python (automation & analysis)
- GitHub (portfolio)
- Medium / Substack (documentation)
